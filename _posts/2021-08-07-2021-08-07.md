Sorry I don't have much cool multimedia this time.  Life hasn't been very photo-worthy lately.
It's [Obon](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2286.html) in Japan, so I've got the week off.  I'm planning on climbing Fuji-san next Saturday with my friend Brian, but my current main focus is the new property Sarah & I just made an offer on. \

I've also been working on getting more video footage and editing.  I'm trying to get my stupid demo out, but my computer's been having trouble handling the editing software.  I'm considering getting a more powerful machine, but it seems kind of wasteful considering my desktop back home could probably handle it fine and I'll have it back soon. \
Here's some stupid B-roll of Umeda station that I botched while filming but was small enough to convert to a .gif. \

The Olympics have been cool to watch on TV.  Skateboarding and BMX has been pretty interesting, and it's been cool to see Japan and the US demonstrating athleticism and technical mastery in so many sports.  I'm sure a lot of folks blame the Olympics on the spike in covid cases, but I'm still really glad the country has been hosting the games.  There's not as much magnificence as the 2008 Beijing games, but the fact that the games didn't implode in 2021 is a geo-political win in my opinion.  \
Most prefectures have another "state of emergency", but it's pretty toothless aside from restaurants not serving alcohol (a major annoyance though, to be sure).  In my view, it mostly looks like posturing and saving face (again).  Despite the low vaccination rate in Japan, there's now a vaccine shortage here, and most people it seems aren't planning on getting it even if it's available.  In the gif above, you can actually see some anti-vaccine demonstrators with signs by the crosswalk. \
I got invited to a baseball game at Kyocera stadium last week, and while attendance was notably down, it was nice to hang out with some old friends and meet Himu-san's daughter from the Czech Republic. \

 I met my buddy Alex last weekend and had some discussions and drinks until 3 in the morning by the river.  I got to chat with Sophie & Dan the next morning, and met Herve and Mimi at Mimi's 46-story apartment for drinks Thursday (I should have gotten pictures; it's a beautiful view).  I helped my friend Cat move out of her place this morning.  My Hong Kong friend [to my right, pictured below] just moved to Tokyo, and I'm having some food & drinks with a few friends this evening on the roof. \

That's all.  I've got today.  I should have more cool stuff next time \
