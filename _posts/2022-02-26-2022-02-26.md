Apologies for the overdue update!  I've been pretty occupied with finishing my work, closing up in Osaka, saying goodbye to friends, and adjusting to life back in Chicagoland.

# 2022-01-08
### Starbucks
I finished my last blog post in a Starbucks in Umeda.

### Fukushima Photography
I shot a bit west of Umeda in the Fukushima ward.  Fukushima-ku's less hectic than Umeda but still has plenty of excellent restaurants.

I started at an underground garden area by the Umeda Holly's Cafe that I like to hang out at.

I went north up a ramp.

Lighting is difficult, so not many shots were very good.  Here's a neat Offal restaurant:

Fukushima shop road:

Breadshop with manga-style wall-art.  As you can see, the family looks like a happy Mother, Father, adorable daughter, Artist-Uncle, and Bread-Headed-Uncle.  I'd love to hear the story that inspired this.

Underground shops by the station.  Most of them were closed, but it seemed scenic.

### Meow Meow Party
Afterwards I headed over to Meow-Meow's for a hot-pot party.  Meow-Meow, his girlfriend Maimai, and our friend Nana enjoy meeting at Maimai's for hotpot, drinks, and games.  Apartment parties aren't terribly common in Japan, but Maimai and Meow-Meow are excellent hosts.

Unfortunately, Nana missed the last train and had to get home to rest up for the the next day's work schedul.  I brought her downstairs to my bike, adjusted the seatpost, clipped my blinking helmet on her head, and sent her on her way.  While that left me with a ~3km walk home, I enjoyed the opportunity for some more photography on the way.

### Yodogawa Return
I snapped this waddling cyclist past 2AM.  He was moving so slowly that it was easy to get my camera out, click on a lens, and get a few shots on him.  I don't know how some people ride so slowly.

I got my fisheye lens for shots like this:

These apartment buildings (and neon cross) are a landmark by home along the river.

# Shinsekai (2022-01-09)
I had to pick up my bike the next day by Nana, who lives by Shinsekai.  Like most lively districts, Shinsekai has an illuminated sign by its dominant areas

The food regions are beautiful, but a bit subdued amidst the Omicron-era.

My parents always say they want more photos of me, so I tried this one by a bridge.  Here ya go, Ma and Pa:

Fisheye is pretty  nice for broad landscapes as well.  This city is so beautiful at night.  On the right-side you can see the retrovirus-looking [Tsutenkaku](https://www.osakastation.com/shinsekai-and-the-tsutenkaku-tower/) tower.

Here's a road:

# Snow in Osaka (2022-01-12)
we had a few snow flakes in Osaka!  Felt just like home!

# Sunset by Roof (2022-01-13)
Our roof has some good views at sunset.

# Meow Meow Party (2022-01-22)
Meow-Meow, Maimai, and I had a three-player hot-pot party!

# Random cooking (2022-01-25)
I thought it'd be neat to video myself working on a stir-fry dinner.
