Apologies for the overdue update.  I've been pretty occupied with finishing my work, closing up in Osaka, saying goodbye to friends, and adjusting to life back in Chicagoland.

# 2022-01-08
### Starbucks
I finished my last blog post in a Starbucks in Umeda.

### Fukushima Photography
I shot a bit west of Umeda in the Fukushima ward.  Fukushima-ku's less hectic than Umeda but still has plenty of excellent restaurants.

I started at an underground garden area by the Umeda Holly's Cafe that I like to hang out at.

I went north up a ramp.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931827501_586b85c092_c.jpg)

Lighting is difficult, so not many shots were very good.  Here's a neat Offal restaurant:

Fukushima shop road:

Breadshop with manga-style wall-art.  As you can see, the family looks like a happy Mother, Father, adorable daughter, Artist-Uncle, and Bread-Headed-Uncle.  I'd love to hear the story that inspired this.

Underground shops by the station.  Most of them were closed, but it seemed scenic.

### Meow Meow Party
Afterwards I headed over to Meow-Meow's for a hot-pot party.  Meow-Meow, his girlfriend Maimai, and our friend Nana enjoy meeting at Maimai's for hotpot, drinks, and games.  Apartment parties aren't terribly common in Japan, but Maimai and Meow-Meow are excellent hosts.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932450580_e75243fd3b_c.jpg)

Unfortunately, Nana missed the last train and had to get home to rest up for the the next day's work schedul.  I brought her downstairs to my bike, adjusted the seatpost, clipped my blinking helmet on her head, and sent her on her way.  While that left me with a ~3km walk home, I enjoyed the opportunity for some more photography on the way.

### Yodogawa Return
I snapped this waddling cyclist past 2AM.  He was moving so slowly that it was easy to get my camera out, click on a lens, and get a few shots on him.  I don't know how some people ride so slowly.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931370664_5e408097ac_c.jpg)

I got my fisheye lens for shots like this:
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51930060732_918bfccf2c_c.jpg)

These apartment buildings (and neon cross) are a landmark along the river.

# Shinsekai (2022-01-09)
I had to pick up my bike the next day by Nana, who lives by Shinsekai.  Like most lively districts, Shinsekai has an illuminated sign by its dominant areas
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932107349_b8447b23ea_c.jpg)

The food regions are beautiful, but a bit subdued amidst the Omicron-era.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931858193_42bdacc967_c.jpg)

My parents always say they want more photos of me, so I tried this one by a bridge.  Here ya go, Ma and Pa:
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931778331_dd089359cb_c.jpg)

Fisheye is pretty  nice for broad landscapes as well.  This city is so beautiful at night.  On the right-side you can see the retrovirus-looking [Tsutenkaku](https://www.osakastation.com/shinsekai-and-the-tsutenkaku-tower/) tower.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931778551_1358660fac_c.jpg)

Here's a road:

# Snow in Osaka (2022-01-12)
Osaka had a few snowflakes!  Felt just like home!
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932433555_997ff13a66_c.jpg)

# Sunset by Roof (2022-01-13)
Our roof has some good views at sunset.

# Meow Meow Party (2022-01-22)
Meow-Meow, Maimai, and I had a three-player hot-pot party.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51929797552_815e90d5f1_c.jpg)

# Random cooking (2022-01-25)
I thought it'd be neat to video myself working on a stir-fry dinner.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932343779_a86fcb267e_o.gif)

# Overcast Day (2022-01-26)
Osaka had an overcast Wednesday that made for some nice shots.

# (2022-01-29/30)

### Guitar by Yodogawa
I like to play acoustic by the river.  It's chilly these days, but it still vibes.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931994761_c372b2f0f3_o.gif)

### Night out with Luca
My buddy Luca and I had a night out in Dotonbori.  We started at Balabushkas,
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51929809702_005c03a641_c.jpg)

...then went to Voyager Stand,
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932336414_a4b1741166_o.gif)

...and finally returned to Balabushkas.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932336674_66674becfa_o.gif)

# Sleeping Gods (2022-01-30)
My good buddy Luis invited me to play the game [Sleeping Gods](https://www.redravengames.com/sleeping-gods/) at a game lounge.  It's a choose-your-own-adventure type of game that reminds me of Dungeons and Dragons and features a cool story and beautiful art.  Our team was completed by the lovely Luisa from Berlin, who was a pleasure to talk to.  
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51930791811_0156bbaa76_b.jpg)

A few days later we continued our quest with a new teammate Asa
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932638445_ae8916244e_c.jpg)

We played pretty late into the evening, and I arrived home around 11pm
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931042152_f54843de36_c.jpg)

# Night Out with Luca & Vincent (2022-02-04)
Luca, Vincent, & I visited Balabushkas and Voyager

# Talking with Kagura & Callan (2022-02-08)
During a dinner at the sharehosue I had a long conversation with Callan and Kagura.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934119163_12142b2f2b_c.jpg)

# Meow Party (2022-02-10)
Meow-Meow, Maimai, and myself had another party.  Maimai showed me her sketch-journal.  Maimai's a talented photographer and artist, and I enjoyed her portrayal of her life as a black cat coupled with the eccentric cat representing Meow-Meow.  I'm a happy penguin, which makes me pretty happy.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932650665_00de14d0e3_c.jpg)

# Hokkaido
A few months earlier, Asako invited me to join a trip to Hokkaido with her, Alex, and our friend Devin.  Hokkaido's been at the top of my list of places to travel, so I of course pounced.

### 2022-02-11
I finished packing for a few days and left my room in its natural cluttered state.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932366154_dc93268b3d_c.jpg)

Snow was clearly visible at the airport.  It felt good to have some brisk weather again.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931056752_8cbdc0cf93_c.jpg)

Sapporo, the most prominent city of Hokkaido, is known for heavy snowfall and its lights.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932120208_4ba39a7219_c.jpg)
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931057302_ca909aaf20_c.jpg)
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932371934_9897c2b6e9_c.jpg)

I checked into my capsule hotel before meeting the crew for dinner.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932038146_9dcd0bb35f_c.jpg)

Alex, Asako, and I met our old friend Sachi at an izakaya.  
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932080771_6f472bb1e5_c.jpg)

The food was fantastic.  The oysters were excellent both grilled and raw, but the sweet and crunchy fried chicken still makes me hungry just thinking about it.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932369084_90c739be50_c.jpg)

After dinner we cruised around Sapporo.  The State of Emergency ensured that we had a pretty tame night, but we got some drinks from the convenience stores and tried out some outfits at the Don Quijote.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931101392_436c923bb8_c.jpg)
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932039196_010874311a_c.jpg)

Sachi had to catch her last train and Alex & Asako returned to their hotel, so I took the opportunity to shoot a bit in the city.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931062082_3cbed94f16_c.jpg)

### Niseko Day 1 (2022-02-12)
The next day we met early to catch our bus to Niseko-san for snowboarding.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932078161_d7e5e188e2_c.jpg)

A few hours later, the mountain was in sight
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932412484_7523f72472_c.jpg)

We got our gear, and hit the slopes at Niseko Annpuri.  Hokkaido is known for it's fluffy snow, and my goodness it didn't disappoint.

![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931098282_6c220ef401_c.jpg)
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932051426_d37b8ed6ac_c.jpg)
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931098327_bf844ec033_c.jpg)

I really enjoyed going through the woods areas since the snow is less ridden and the maneuvering is exciting.  Visibility and focus are pretty nearsighted though, so big drops like this one snuck up on me.  The picture doesn't capture depth very well, but I believe I avoided a 10+ meter fall onto the main path here.

![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932382394_c1374a7123_c.jpg)

Eventually night came and we gathered by the bus stop to travel to our lodge.

![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931072697_dcff4795b6_c.jpg)

Alex and I hustled to the nearest store to get some food and drinks.  It was about 2km with an early closing time, but we made it to the scenic town just in time.

![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934654384_f9500a9396_c.jpg)

Selection was scarce and prices were high in this mountain village, but we got what we needed to finish the night.

![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934331961_9cdd1932f6_c.jpg)

### Niseko Day 2 (2022-02-13)
The next morning we had an excellent breakfast at the lodge.  The staff was very friendly, and  we left for an alternate resort.

![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932387789_82db061888_c.jpg)


![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931078047_a136f2af15_c.jpg)

![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932059636_bd963fc478_c.jpg)

After boarding all day, we walked about 40min to the nearest mixed onsen.

![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931099122_059c282c85_c.jpg)

I've got mixed feelings about getting in steaming hot water naked with a bunch of other folks, and I generally find it uncomfortable personally.  This one was outdoors in the snow and very beautiful.  I'd love to share pics, but I was pretty busy being hot, embarrassed about my body, and forbidden from bringing a camera in.

### Return (2022-02-14)
We had to return our gear the next morning, but I got a few neat shots of strangers at the resort.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931083427_e66c9897bb_c.jpg)
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932064376_8068f03802_c.jpg)

We bussed back to Sapporo and walked around a bit.  Here's a neat building.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932139223_ebb76eef95_c.jpg)

Hokkaido is known for its fresh and clean seafood, and we got some fresh bowls right next to the fish market.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932140023_91d80a3647_c.jpg)

The fish market was cool.  I got hungry again just off the smells.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932065646_cb52d0d538_c.jpg)

Alex met a worthy opponent in a shoutengai.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932396494_7365299765_c.jpg)

We missed our bus and were freaking out about missing our flight on this road.  We made it by train and by sprint though.

# Sleeping Gods (2022-02-15)
Luis, Luisa, Asa and I continued our quest in Sleeping Gods.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932729465_68b9a611ea_c.jpg)
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932729805_af565012d1_c.jpg)

# Last Day of Work (2022-02-17)
For my last day I returned to the office to return my gear and sign some papers.  I treated myself to my favorite groccery-store meal of salmon sushi and vegetable juice.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932443299_eb17b81eb5_c.jpg)

# Hotaru Lunch (2022-02-18)
I had lunch with my buddy Hotaru.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934050456_aebd06e72f_c.jpg)\

# Night Out with Mary 2022-02-18
I met my friend Mary from the Philippines.  I brought my camera since we're both into amateur photography, and I shot a bit by the Umeda Don Quijote rendezvous point as I waited for her to arrive.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931144487_67c9079890_c.jpg)
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931144787_0d523ffef4_c.jpg)

We met and talked, and decided to walk south to our favorite bars in Shinsaibashi.  We shot a bit along the way.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932204383_e3e5014053_c.jpg)
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932204748_6ba40700b0_c.jpg)
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932205083_755ac3e06d_c.jpg)

I asked her to pose by some blue lights, but without another illumination sourcee, it looks a bit goofy.

![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932743145_075e0ae615_c.jpg)

Here's a big ol' shrine in down Chuo-ku.

![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932206248_91f314f27d_c.jpg)

We finally made it to a bar she and her friends like to meet at.  We had some good conversations, and I met a lot of cool folks.  It's wonderful how after nearly three years in Osaka I still find I have so many cool places to visit and excellent people to meet.

![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932740185_f1ba97e2d5_c.jpg)
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932122746_b1f803ae21_c.jpg)

Eventually Mary had to return by her last train, so I walked back to my bike and had some pasta before hitting the pillow.

# 2022-02-22
### Mary at the Airport
Mary and I agreed to meet at the [Itami Sky Park](https://goo.gl/maps/rYPGEk5uwGbZFd1EA) by Itami airport to shoot.  It's very common to see folks shooting pictures of planes by Itami, and today we'd join them.  Unfortunately, Mary was having some difficulty with her new second-hand bike having a flat tire, so she only arrived after the sun set and getting clear shots became difficult.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932986645_b5ac1dc544_c.jpg)

![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932446808_a7d0c81f5b_c.jpg)

At last she arrived, but we mostly winged about how cold and windy it was and how much nicer this beautiful park must be during the warmer seasons.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932989750_5ca77bf234_c.jpg)

![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932701349_dc512105da_c.jpg)

I let her try my road bike, which she loved, but wee had to part ways so I could meet the lads at Torikizoku in Dotonbori.

### Noah's Last Stand at Torikizoku
Noah was soon scheduled for a return to Australia, so Luca 1, Luca 2, Callum, and I assembled for a final night out.  We had some good talks over chicken and beer.  Noah's a good guy, and he's got a good future ahead of him.

# Wakayama (2022-02-23/24)
My friend Ninni was kind enough to show me around Wakayama.  It's a less-crowded prefecture south of Osaka that features beautiful nature, fresh seafood, and a less stressed pace than Osaka.  I started things out right by meeting her at the incorrect station and shooting photos while I waited for her to pick me up in the car she was renting.

![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51933032815_f3b879b882_c.jpg)

We drove to the fish market and strolled around as we figured out how to treat ourselves.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51933037080_41547e9242_c.jpg)

We settled on grilling fresh fish, vegetables, and oysters.  It was a bit chilly outdoors, but we were warmed by good food and conversation.

![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932495923_bd22b9065b_c.jpg)

Exiting the market, Ninni showed me that we we actually in a part of a larger amusement park.  It had some very European architecture as well as a rollercoaster, water ride, and a talented juggler.  I wish the buildings were real and enterable, but they were sure nice to look at.  I'd love to visit this place during a warmer season, but Ninni said she believed the park was scheduled to be demolished to make room for a casino.  Pity.

![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932496258_7c54d66a6f_c.jpg)

We went to a local lighthouse and saw some wild dogs messing around.
![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931432907_a78c4d7113_c.jpg)

Climbing to the deck of the lighthouse, I got some neat pics of the small nearby islands.  It'd be excellent to kayak to them and have a party during warmer weather.

We continued to a small fishing neighborhood and had a quick coffee in an adorable cafe built into the rocky hills.

We drove around a bit more as the sun set.  Wakayam's a beautiful place, and Ninni is a kind sweet person that I enjoyed spending the day with.

We returned the car, made some quesadillas, and turned in for the night.

The next morning Ninni brought me to a nice cafe for some coffee and breakfast.  Despite the small serving sizes, it was a good meal with a good vibe.

Unfortunately we both had to finish some business that day, so I got on a train back to Osaka.  I got a bit confused with the trains though, and I prematurely exited onto a quite station.  I shot a bit while I waited for the next train.

I like the short focal plane here.  It makes just the ground look interesting.

# Soubetsukai (2022-02-25)
I had a 送別会 (soubetsukai), or a farewell party.

Asako recommended getting an AirBnB, but they have a deliberate <16 person policy to prevent raucous parties like the one I definitely needed to throw.  At the suggestion of Luis, I rented a space on [instapace.jp](https://www.instabase.jp/).  It said it seated 12 people, but we blew past that pretty quick.

While our reservation started around 4pm, the first folks to show up were these legends, Norie and Matsuko, at 6pm.  These lovely ladies even brought me a teapot and green tea as a souvenir!

Then Kagura and Luis showed up!  I compelled them to eat the bananas that I had brought:

By the way, my ridiculous outfit is my Glico Man costume, which is based on the famous [Dotonbori Glico sign](https://japantravelmate.com/osaka/dotonbori-strange-sights-glico-man-sign-ebisu-bridge).  It's a messy shirt that I printed myself, and have worn for the past two Halloweens

Maimai was kind enough to take pictures with the camera that I brought.  She's incredibly talented, and her use of the fisheye here pleases me.

Let's throw food into eachothers' mouths.

Or we can feed each other.  Both are perfectly acceptable.

I DEFINITELY don't deserve to be so close to so many beautiful women, but I'm certainly not complaining!

Luca and I talked a lot about the Ukraine crisis, but we also drank a lot, so we felt better.

I brought a colored floodlight that I used to illuminte my room.  It made for some good mood and atmospheric shots!
