## Fuji
I went with my buddy Brian to Fuji-san last weekend.  It was a haphazardly planned trip, and we made the snap-decision to camp 5km away from Gotemba station on Friday night.  I loaded up my camping gear, and hopped on the Shinkansen for Mishima Station.  You can barely see the mountain from the train:

It's a fairly *inaka* (country) area, so I had to wait for a local transfer for like 40min at a Shimo-Togari station as the sun set:

I walked to [Sumiya Base Camping Ground](https://goo.gl/maps/MvzBQw8kDk6FLgaK7), and set up the tent.  Brian arrived later, but it was so hot & humid that I couldn't sleep and we got some drinks and wandered around the country town. It was good night!

The next morning we make it to Gotemba Station, intending to hike the Gotemba Trail.  This *generally* includes taking a bus 15km from the train station to the trailhead.  However, we decided to hike straight from the train station.  Brian and I are both pretty fit, and the extra distance seemed like a small obstacle that would give us little trouble in exchange for extra satisfaction.  In hindsight, this was a mistake for me.  It was pretty hot and humid as we walked through the early afternoon, and I was pretty dehydrated, exhausted, and demoralized by the time we reached the trailhead several hours later.  With a developing blister on my foot, I was seriously considering taking the bus back down instead of doing the climb.  Brian and some cold soda convinced me to continue, so we set off on the overnight climb.

The rest of the ascent to Fuji's 3,776m peak was a very mixed bag.  The Gotemba trail is mostly a mild gradient, but covered in fist-sized igneous rock that causes your feet to slide a lot.  For an inexperienced hiker like myself, it was pretty difficult to climb with my camping backpack.  Breathing was exhausting, and I deteriorated into pretty bad physical and mental shape as we hiked through the night and I quickly ran out of food and fluids.  We took some time to nap around 11pm, but it was so cold that I couldn't sleep and almost felt worse when we continued an hour-and-a-half later.  I devolved as we hiked higher, and began trash-talking the mountain and panicking about being too weak to even make the descent down without collapsing.  I've collapsed from athletic activity before, and I felt like I was hitting that redline again, but this time miles away from a hospital or ambulance.  Brian was patient and supportive, but ended up traveling ahead to meet the sunrise at the summit.  So on one hand, it was almost certainly the scariest and most unpleasant experience I've had in Japan.

But on the other hand, it was one of the best.  The scenery was ridiculously cool from several kilometers up.  Seeing the sun set against the mountain, and then look at Gotemba, Yokohama, and Tokyo from so high was pretty unique.  Further, the view of the stars was incredible.  I've been pretty interested in astronomy lately, and being able to see the Milky Way with my own eyes was great.  And while I really struggled on the hike, that makes its completion all the more satisfying.

I arrived about 15 min after the sunrise (which was also this cool red-orb poking above the clouds), and Brian was kind enough to take a pic for me.  As you can tell, I was feeling excellent.

Then, of course, we had to descend.  Again, we enjoyed great scenery, but super-unpleasant terrain.  We took a different trail back since it would be shorter overall, but it was steeper and had even more sliding rocks.  I cursed the mountain more before we made it to the Shinkansen and had some drinks on the ride back.

I'm still feeling a little bitter about the trip.  Strength and perseverance are important characteristics that I judge myself by, and this climb really made me feel weak.  I can blame some of it on me packing too much camping gear and not enough food/water, but I still resent feeling as bad as I did.  I might do some weighted hikes in Kansai sometime to get better at this type of stuff.

## Transferring Investigation in Progress
I'm still looking into transferring back to the US with the current company.  I need to do some internal applications, but a lot of them look like good fits that I should be able to thrive in.  Some of the locations don't really excite me for long-term residence, but if the job quality is good enough I think I could make anywhere in the US work for at least a few years.

## Tenant problems
The tenants in our first rental property vacated, but they left us quite a few damages.  We'll be able to recover from many of them, but it's been a disappointing yet educational experience.

## Kettlebell is great
I've been replacing some of my running for rooftop workouts.  I got an adjustable kettlebell, and pretty simple swing workouts have helped a lot with my lower back and core strength.  It's also easier to do in the rain than running.  

## Reading
I got a Kindle and have been reading by the river periodically to clear my head from the "sitting-in-my-room-on-a-computer" life.  I'm mostly reading about homesteading and EMT training, both of which I'm interested in pursuing when I get back to the States.
## Osaka .gifs
I caught up with a friend over dinner at a Thai place and read in Triangle Park a bit while I waited.  It's not super-exciting to write about, but gives me an excuse to throw more .gifs into this.
