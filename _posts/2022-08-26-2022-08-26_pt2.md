I made the pilgrimage to Engineering Open House (EOH) at UIUC in April. 

## EOH (04-09 -> 04-10)
This student-convention at the university features presentations and projects by many clubs, including the EcoIllini and iRobotics clubs that I was a part of during my university time.

iRobotics continues to host a combat-robotics tournament that many of my alumni friends compete in.

It's been great to see the competition grow over the years.  The tournament started as a pretty small competition that had been tucked away inside a student building.  This April it was hosted right next to the busiest street on campus with teams from all over the Midwest competing.

A few out my outstanding alumni friends have also been working on the heavy-weight bot <i>Deadlift</i>.  EOH is a great exhibition opportunity for PR and outreach.

The crowd swells the most of course during the actual fights:

I tried to get some shots, but the polycarbonate panels and dense crowd made it difficult to get much better than this:

The crowd cleared pretty quickly after an effective strike started a battery fire.  There wasn't much of a flame, but the smoke and gases produced aren't good for one's health:

Once the smoke had cleared, the team took a good look at their machine.

Our fellow alum showed up with our pal Remi.  It's always good to see them.

Fights have a lot of time between them so teams can repair and adjust their machines, so there was plenty of time to talk to friends.

The out-of-town teams were also a pleasure to have around.  I spent a good time talking to a lovely Northwestern student who had been on the show BattleBots.

<i>Deadlift</i> had also been on Battlebots, and there was plenty of interest from folks of all ages.

I tried to take some glamour shots of Deadlift for my friends:

There were plenty of dogs too.

The dogs sparred a bit themselves.  They're just playing; nobody got hurt.

Robot fights on the other hand provided plenty of chaotic entertainment.  When neither bot has been disabled after a couple minutes, matches typically go to a judge's decision where they declare a winner based on damage given/received.

The Final Match concluded with Dan's horizontal spinner knocking out the opposition.  Dan, one of the founding members of the competition, is one of the most experienced builders, and his victory is well deserved.

Of course, not competition would be complete without trash-talking at a bar afterwards.  The alumni gathered, had a good meal in Champaign, and hopped bars late into the night.

I love seeing these folks.  They're all incredibly competent and intelligent and are doing awesome things in life.  They're all just good people as well.  It's a pleasure to talk trash about robots, but the heavier conversations after a few drinks are even better.  I'm really blessed to have them in my life.

Of course, I can't help but remember the good souls back in Japan.  A street sign reminded me of Brady-san on a recovery run the next morning.
