## ATL 1 (03-13 -> 03-23)
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/2022-03-13_atl1/0_house_r.jpg)
I arrived in Atlanta mid-March.  I was very anxious to get to the rental houses that my partner and I have.  
On one hand it was a joy to see these properties in person.  

![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/2022-03-13_atl1/1_houseOverwhelm_r.jpg)
On the other hand, I quickly felt overwhelmed.  Items that used to be simple numbers on a spreadsheet quickly unfolded into a complex web of problems.  Problems have solutions, but finding the best solution requires wading through a sea of information and thought.  Searching for a good solution, I often found more problems and more questions than when I began.  A small todo-list that I had budgeted to knock out in a few weeks quickly grew into a long novel to tasks.


Take this door for instance.

![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/2022-03-13_atl1/2_houseDoor_r.jpg)

This door was supposed to be a quick fix: remove the temporary, OSB swap in a new pre-hung unit from Home Depot, and move on.  Any 2-bit Neanderthal should be able to handle this in half of a day.  Instead, investigation showed that there was moisture accumulating at the bottom that had caused the subfloor to swell.  Removing the subfloor involved removing some of the new vinly plank, which required removing some of the baseboard moulding, during which I dented some drywall and damaged the moulding.  Exposing the subfloor showed that the framing had been damaged and should be replaced.  But the framing is load-bearing, and requires installing jacks to lift up to clear out the rotted plate.  But since the old deck is anchored, the deck will need to be removed, moved a few feet West, and supported on jacks before it is returned.  And by the way, there's a particleboard subfloor that will irreparably swell if it gets wet, and best practice is to completely remove it before we build partition walls on top of it.  And beneath that is plywood subfloor, which is only 7/16", and probably thinner than recommended for anyone more massive than a typical Takushi.  Oh, and the siding is a mix of particleboard that is also not best practice.  And the gutters that splashed water down here ought to be replaced.  Also, the deck itself hasn't been built to contemporary standards and should have probably half the pieces replaced.  Neglecting any of these problems could be a liability, so these problems need solutions.

If you followed me through that, you can hopefully understand that this 2-bit Neanderthal couldnt' finish this in half of a day.  I must have spent multiple days reading and researching what the best solution is, how to help pay for it, and whether or not I could handle the task myself.  We'd get a handyman out to take a look at it, have them stop working when they figured out the problem was bigger than they could handle, and get another guy who quoted us an estimate thousands of dollars higher than we were ready to pay.

I had hoped to be done in Atlanta before my Dad's retirement party in a few weeks, but that didn't happen.

On the plus side, I figured out how to get work done.  Neither of the properties I found to be great work environments, especially given the lack of internet in the vacant house.  I'd often go to Panera to get some carbs, coffee, and spend some time researching home improvement, DIY solutions, and local labor.

The houses themselves were nice places to live though for the most part.  There are more pics later.

## Dad's retirement (03-23 -> 03-27)
So a few weeks later, my sister I drove up to Dad's retirement party in Chicago.  

There was a lot of really heart-warming testimony about our Father and his long career in the office.  Dad rarely discusses his job with us, so it was really refreshing to hear about his good performance and supportive role in his team's culture.  I should have taken more pictures.

While I was up in Chicago, I of course went running.  A cat with glasses drawn on a sign of course reminded me of my friend Meow-Meow back in Kansai.

We had obligations back in Atlanta on Monday, so we drove back South the following day.  Taco Bell along the way was good.

## ATL 2 (03-27 -> 04-09)
I gained more traction back in Atlanta.  Walls were painted, plumbing was fixed, and deck boards replaced.  I spent a few hours in the sun patching this roof after I found leaks by the satellite dish.  
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/03-27_atl2/0_roofDamage_r.jpg)

It's fine now.

And again, it was nice catching up with my sister over dinner from time to time.

## EOH (04-09 -> 04-10)
Engineering Open House (EOH) at UIUC was in April.  This student-convention at the university features presentations and projects by many clubs, including the EcoIllini and iRobotics clubs that I was a part of during my university time.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/04-09_eoh/00_deadliftClose_r.JPG)

iRobotics continues to host a combat-robotics tournament that many of my alumni friends compete in.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/04-09_eoh/01_alumniBuilder_r.JPG)


It's been great to see the competition grow over the years.  The tournament started as a pretty small competition that had been tucked away inside a student building.  This April it was hosted right next to the busiest street on campus with teams from all over the Midwest competing.  
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/04-09_eoh/02_pitsMorning_r.JPG)

A few out my outstanding alumni friends have also been working on the heavy-weight bot <i>Deadlift</i>.  EOH is a great exhibition opportunity for PR and outreach.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/04-09_eoh/03_deadliftExplanationGuy_r.JPG)

The crowd swells the most of course during the actual fights:
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/04-09_eoh/04_audienceFisheye_r.JPG)

I tried to get some shots, but the polycarbonate panels and dense crowd made it difficult to get much better than this:
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/04-09_eoh/05_robotFight_r.JPG)

The crowd cleared pretty quickly after an effective strike started a battery fire.  There wasn't much of a flame, but the smoke and gases produced aren't good for one's health:
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/04-09_eoh/06_batteryFire_r.JPG)

Once the smoke had cleared, the team took a good look at their machine.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/04-09_eoh/07_batteryAutopsy_r.JPG)

Our fellow alum showed up with our pal Remi.  It's always good to see them.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/04-09_eoh/08_alumRemi_r.JPG)

Fights have a lot of time between them so teams can repair and adjust their machines, so there was plenty of time to talk to friends.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/04-09_eoh/09_alumFriends_r.JPG)

The out-of-town teams were also a pleasure to have around.  I spent a good time talking to a lovely Northwestern student who had been on the show BattleBots.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/04-09_eoh/10_nwFolks_r.JPG)

<i>Deadlift</i> had also been on Battlebots, and there was plenty of interest from folks of all ages.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/04-09_eoh/11_deadliftCurious_r.JPG)

I tried to take some glamour shots of Deadlift for my friends:

There were plenty of dogs too.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/04-09_eoh/12_dogPack_r.JPG)

The dogs sparred a bit themselves.  They're just playing; nobody got hurt.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/04-09_eoh/13_dogPlay_r.JPG)

Robot fights on the other hand provided plenty of chaotic entertainment.  When neither bot has been disabled after a couple minutes, matches typically go to a judge's decision where they declare a winner based on damage given/received.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/04-09_eoh/14_damageAssessment_r.JPG)

The Final Match concluded with Dan's horizontal spinner knocking out the opposition.  Dan, one of the founding members of the competition, is one of the most experienced builders, and his victory is well deserved.

Of course, not competition would be complete without trash-talking at a bar afterwards.  The alumni gathered, had a good meal in Champaign, and hopped bars late into the night.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/04-09_eoh/16_legends_r.jpg)

I love seeing these folks.  They're all incredibly competent and intelligent and are doing awesome things in life.  They're all just good people as well.  It's a pleasure to talk trash about robots, but the heavier conversations after a few drinks are even better.  I'm really blessed to have them in my life.

Of course, I can't help but remember the good souls back in Japan.  A street sign reminded me of Brady-san on a recovery run the next morning.

Here's a more complete Flickr album of Robobrawl2022 if you're interested (I'm trying to get away from hosting on Flickr as I try to get more into AWS, but hey, it's already there):

## Atl 3 (04-11 -> 06-10)
I returned to Atlanta to continue work.  We were getting close to putting one rental on the market, but still had to do some repairs, polishing, and marketing.

A crawlspace was giving me trouble.  We only recently installed French drains to deal with drainage issues, and moisture problems can be catastrophic.  Built in the 50's, the house doesn't conform to contemporary construction codes.  The vapor barrier is ineffectively installed, there's no good ventilation, and the height is so low that maneuvering is difficult for even a guy like me.  It gets pretty claustrophobic down there.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/04-11_atl3/00_crawlspaceSurprised_r.jpg)

The deck needed some work, and I'd often get a meal at the local Taco Bell when I needed the energy.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/04-11_atl3/01_tacobell_r.jpg)

Once the houses were in presentation-quality condition, I took some time for some careful photography for marketing and documenting the condition.  It's difficult to get presentable shots when a resident occupies a space, and good quality photography is pretty critical for marketing, so I tried to do as best as I could for this.  You're welcome to check out the flickr albums below.

Of course, doing my final checks I found that the dishwasher was leeching foam when I ran it with dish soap, which covered the floor.  Turns out that it's common knowledge that liquid dish soap shouldn't be used in an automatic washer.  I guess I'm uncommonly uninformed.

Anyway, when I went into the crawlspace to check for water damage, I found that the drain actually had a leak at a slip joint.  

![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/04-11_atl3/02_crawlspacePlumbing_r.jpg)
A few attempts at sealing it with putty and tightening it like a Neanderthal solved the problem.

Finally, I published the add and started managing leads.  This was my professional office for about a week and a half.

![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/04-11_atl3/03_businessDesk_r.jpg)

Dealing with DIY repairs takes technical competence.  That excites me.  Dealing with people takes a lot of social patience, which excites me less.  I'll spare you the majority of my winging, but if you ever meet a rude Property Manager, I hope you can understand that for them normal business likely includes hours of waiting for no-shows, being blatantly lied to, and having their promising relationships routinely ghosted.  It was also hard to be stern and hold onto standards when sympathy gets a grip.  I had to turn away several young families that only had a few days before they were homeless because they couldn't meet our requirements.  A lot of folks also didn't speak English or have sufficient documents.  I can typically hack my way through a Spanish conversation enough to communicate with most Latin folks, and I learned some new relevant vocab like <i>disonsible</i> ("vacant"), and <i>puntaje de crédito</i> ("credit score").  

At times though communication broke down, and I'd have an angry fellow giving me a death stare as I try to explain our requirements to his girlfriend on the phone.  That one fell through because the guy didn't have any proof of income, identification, SSN/TIN, or a bank.  He didn't even have an email or know how to use a computer.  As he glared at me, I felt his frustration of not being understood by the annoying locals who refuse to compromise on seemingly arbitrary and ridiculous rules.  That was me back in Japan.  And with the tables flipped, I felt increasingly intimidated by the agitated gaikokujin and his ominous 200lb sidekick in the corner.  I'd bet that most Japanese feel similarly uncomfortable when they meet a troubling foreigner like me in their country.

Eventually they understood that we couldn't reach an agreement.  We shook hands, and they left.  Despite the local/foreigner relationship reversal, there may be little duality in our fortunes.  I got to go to schools that prepared me well to thrive in the most prosperous country in the world.  Other folks hid in the bottom of a boat just to get here.  They seize the opportunities for hard labor, start their own businesses, and send large portions of their income back to their families back home.  They came here despite not knowing some basic tech skills that we take for granted, and despite not knowing the native language.  Still, through dedication and mastery of their craft, they can support themselves and their families both locally and internationally.  I shouldn't glorify a demographic based on the trends that I note, but I also can't help but respect a lot of the folks I get to meet from other walks of life.

These properties were my top priority in my life for quite a while.  As long as they were vacant, they were liabilities to my partner and I.  As long as we had outstanding liabilities, it felt hard to justify coming back up to family in Chicagoland, searching for software jobs, or indulging in any luxuries like fun.  Despite this, I tried to have some "me time", which included runs.

Those runs occasionally included this guy.  I looked behind me one morning, and this meatball was sprinting after me.  I slowed down and try show him that I meant no harm, and within in a minute we're doing belly-rubs.  Any time I run by his intersection, we'd say hello.

Turns out, there were other dogs in the neighborhood, and a possee paid my backyard office a visit once when I left the gate open.

There were some cats too, but they kept their distance from the canines.

Sometimes they go on the roof.

Other creatures go on the roof as well.

Lizards kept their distance from cats.

Speaking of nature, our suburbs have some pretty nice parks.  I took a break one day and paid Brook Run Park a visit.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/04-11_atl3/09_parkField_r.JPG)

I found a copperhead snake.

I wasn't sure if this guy was dangerous or not, but [https://www.ajc.com/life/home-garden/6-venomous-snakes-to-watch-out-for-in-georgia/TWFREY7QMLLUC4HKBSZCAW6GXA/](this) says that <i>Copperheads are responsible for the majority of snakebites in the Southeast each year.</i>.  

Oh.

The parks are nice, but even our houses have some natural beauty.

Our neighbors have a small boy who occasionally runs in unannounced and follows me around like a Pikachu.  He gets in the way and is a liability if there's construction debris lying about, but I have a hard time telling him to go home.  He seems to have a ton of energy, but not enough outlets.  Having a child must be nice, but making sure this guy doesn't throw all my boards off the deck while I'm painting takes some extra attention.

Anyway, this guy likes to play with my camera and gave me a glamor shot.

Our area in general is really beautiful at times.  Walmart's parking lot isn't the same as "sunsets by Yodogawa", but it's alright.

It's nice to see construction happening as well.

## Chicago Weekend (06-10 -> 06-16)
A retirement party for my highschool theatre director brought me back to Skokie.  The timing was unfortunately in conflict with my cousin's wedding in Vancouver, but my Dad and sister were fortunately able to represent our family there.  My theatre director, Mr. O, was one of my most important mentors growing up.  Our theatre department was outstandingly strong, putting on 7+ productions every year and giving students like myself were given opportunities not only perform and build but also design and direct.  Working with such a dedicated and competent staff certainly inspired students like myself to be similarly driven and competent in all things we do.  Mr. O's truthful honest also helped a lot of us students learn more about the world and being an adult, and while his strong conviction and business-class discipline could feel hurtful at times, a soft student like me needed that for growth.  There was plenty of testimony and performances at the celebration that showed what Mr. O means to us, and it was great to see other beloved staff, parents, and alumni.

Of course, ya boi failed to photography any of it.  Sorry about that.


Since I was up in Chicagoland though, I took some time to visit some other friends.  I have access to a car, but it's often more convenient for me to take the train, especially if I'm planning on enjoying the Devil's Juice.
It was my first time riding Chicago trains in a while.  I miss Japan's trains.

I arrived early so I hung out in a park for a bit.

We got tacos and went to a blues club.  I really should have taken more pictures.  Sorry, folks.

Instead, here's Howard station on another night out.

My friends and I went to see our comrade Leah perform.  Leah is many things, but singer-songwriter is one of the best ways to describe her.  Leah's been a friend since high-school, and I've always admired her as talented, driven, and clever.  
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/06-10_chicagoland/03_leahScene_r.JPG)

I thought I'd shoot a bit, but I really struggled to produce good results.  On one hand the colors are really cool, but the low light is difficult.  I can slow the shutter speed if I can keep the camera and subject still, but increasing sensitivity results in noise and my lenses only have such an open aperture.  I'm also on a compact ASP-C sensor that takes in less light per pixel.  I'm also not a great photographer.

Despite my mediocre results, I'd love to do more low-light and event photography.  That's like a 3rd-order priority right now though.

I went to Chicago to do a few Craigslist deals (router and laptop dock).  I shot a bit while I was making my way round town.

My last deal was down by 35th.  This isn't an area I'm very familiar with, and the South Side of the city doesn't have a great reputation for safety.  Boarding along 35th during daylight though was pretty nice.  The neighborhood had a different vibe than Skokie, but passerbys were only pleasant to me.  A guy high-fived me as I rode past on my longboard, which never happens to me up north.

After I got home, I looked into properties down south.  The price maps have some overlap with crime maps, but it's worth looking into more if I find myself tied to this city.

But first I needed to head back to Atlanta.  I took a picture with the parents and headed off.

## Atl 4 (06-17 -> 07-12)
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/06-17_atl4/00_driving_r.jpg)
I've been pretty good at doing Chicago<-->Atlanta drive in a day.  I've listened to the audiobook "Understanding Russia" like seven times at this point.

Our rental strategy changed for one of the houses, and the new plan was to add bedrooms in the basement.

This involved building new partition walls on the subfloor.  I won't talk your ear off regarding all the details and complications, but here's me removing some of the previous carpet underlayment.  
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/06-17_atl4/01_carpetRemoval.mp4)

I like a nice warm carpet floor in the winter, but my goodness, it gets so dirty and gross.  Carpet's such a pain to replace that I'm kind of turned off of it.  It tasted pretty awful too.


Wood framing is fun though.

I tried making periodic vlogs at the end of the day to better process and document my work.  Here's a sped-up version to save data.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/06-17_atl4/03_framingVlog.mp4)

Framing was easy, but transporting materials was a pain.  I was able to fit a few prehung doors in the Ford Escape, but it was dicey:
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/06-17_atl4/04_carDoors_r.jpg)

For 4'x8' drywall sheets I had to rent a van.  Driving such a larger vehicle was spooky at first, but it quickly grew on me.  I could see myself getting one of these in the future.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/06-17_atl4/05_imInAVan_r.jpg)

Drywall mudding was a challenge for me.  I had never done anything more than spackle touch-ups, so jumping in to preparing, applying, and finishing the mud didn't go well at first.  I'd mix the wrong consistency mud, then apply it like an amateur, then try to touch it up, botch another part, and after it dried for half a day I'd see all the inconsistencies and try to patch it again.  I slowly got better at mixing and application, and eventually started getting pretty good results as I refined the coats.  Unfortunately, this took me several more days than it should have, and it was pretty rough seeing that time lost, especially after knocking out the framing in only a few days.  Add the Atlanta heat in a house that I refused to use AC in, and I'm glad those days are behind me.  It was pretty dirty too.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/06-17_atl4/06_drywallSelfie_r.jpg)
I've still got mud stains on my boots.

But the final results were pretty good in my humble opinion.  The walls looked pretty good to me after primer and paint; I couldn't even tell where my own seams were.  Here's another sped-up vlog of me talking to myself about my works.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/06-17_atl4/07_vlogFinal.mp4)

Eventually though, my partner found a Property Manger who also manages renovations.  He gave us a reasonable quote for finishing my work, and we took it.  I've got mixed feelings.  On one hand I'm glad to delegate the work to his team that specializes in this sort of project.  Being green at this, I spend a lot of time analyzing my work and trying to do it perfectly when it really ought to be done to a more pragmatic standard.  I know they'll also likely work more efficiently, and with a larger team, certainly faster.  On the other hand, I believe that as an owner of the results, nobody will put more care and detail into a project than I will.  Further, I always fear that depending on others will put me at their mercy, and I should be able to execute as many of the responsiblites in my business as I can to ensure sovereignty, gain expertise, and be a better owner.  Plus, I was feeling really anxious to get on with my life.  It's easy to feel like a loser when an estimated two-week hiatus in your career turns into four months of semi-nomadic unemployment.  It was a mixed bag stepping away from Atlanta, but I'm still cautiously optimistic that this will work out well with our PM's management.

Spending time with my sister was always nice.  My life has felt pretty frustrating since I left Japan, and unfortunately my headspace has made it hard to be optimistic and pleasant.  As siblings, I feel it can be extra easy for us to butt heads at times as we have less patience with each other.  My sister is someone that I've always respected and admired though, and I'm glad to have her in my life in these strange times of mine.

She also introduced me to some of her friends, including Justin, a more seasoned longboarder.  There's a lot of great folks down in Atlanta, and I wish I could see them again.

My sister saw me off at a final dinner at Don Pedro's.  It was pretty good.  Mexcian food is one of the things I missed most about the US.

## Chicago Return (07-12 -> present)
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/07-12_chicagoland/00_lakesideTitle_r.JPG)
I've been in Chicagoland mid July.

I'm living with my parents right now and trying to be supportive as my Mom's health changes.  It's frustrating since there are a lot of core problems that I can't fix, but I <i>can</i> help with cooking, cleaning, caretaking, and upkeep around the house.  I can help make sure that my folks are eating well, have another hand in the house, and can free up some time to do other things.  
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/07-12_chicagoland/01_dadReadingOutside_r.jpg)

After a galivanting-good time of exploring in Japan, returning home to live with my parents doesn't always feel like a step forward.  If I let it get to my head, it can feel disappointing, embarrassing, and frustrating.  If I think clearly though, I always conclude that our family is stronger together, and the time we have together now has a value that I won't always be able to obtain.  My folks seem to appreciate me here, and while we can get on eachother's nerves from time to time, it's a net-positive arrangement.

My hometown of Skokie is also kind of alright.  There are occasionally performances in the local park.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/07-12_chicagoland/02_skokieMusicians_r.JPG)

Evanston to the East is also nice, and I run/board/read there occasionally.

Chicago itself is alright too.  I visited a good friend and went to [https://goo.gl/maps/CDnAyjGFD9LfGmDi6](Centennial) and [Headquarters Beercade](https://www.hqrivernorth.com/), and I took some pictures in the area afterwards.

My aunt came to visit for a few days as well.  I haven't seen her in a few years, and it was great to catch up.  Don't mind my sourpuss face.  My code wasn't working, so I was in a grumpy mood when Dad said it was time to take pictures.

Outside of pictures, I'm spending most of my time working on building technical skills in software.  Takushi.us started as a simple project for learning Django, which is a backend framework for the web.  I've worked as an <i>embedded</i> software engineer for several years, and while it's interesting, I'm looking to switch to the faster-paced and broader web world.  Among the many reasons for my switch is the fact that getting away from hardware will open up more remote jobs, which is helpful since I can better support my family working from home and easily relocate them if they move in the likely future.

As I got deeper into a Django project, I decided I'd try to flesh it out to demonstrate my fullstack skills as I develop them.  This blog's content isn't my highest priority in life (I last published in March), but it seemed like a no-brainer to integrate it as additional viable material and keep it updated to demonstrate my awareness of content management.  Plus, some of the good people back in Japan reached out to me, and I feel bad not keeping this updated in case they're curious.

I miss those people a lot.  I want to keep them in my life, but it's hard to reach out and be positive when I'm not yet proud of my accomplishments and am frustrated and bitter about this period in my life.  Doing anything social feels really uncomfortable right now, but I'm confident I'll get my pizazz back once I'm gainfully employed and making a good living again.  Once this blog update is pushed, I'll be feeling good enough about this project to be hunting for a new team to contribute to.  I obviously still have a lot of learning to do and improvements to make to this project, but it's at a half-way-decent state that I'm feeling alright about.

Sitting in my room at my computer fries my brain though, so I've finally started pursuing gardening up in Skokie.  My parents haven't paid much attention to the garden in the back, so they gave me the blessing to plant there.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/07-12_chicagoland/08_backyardTree_r.JPG)

There was a lot of over-growth and weeds that needed to be cleared.  I had a fun day swinging with the shovel and machete in the sun.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/07-12_chicagoland/09_gardenBefore_r.JPG)

I have very little experience gardening and not much time to learn.  August is already pretty late in the season, but I decided it was better to recklessly jump in headfirst and sow as soon as possible instead of carefully calculate a plan in a spreadsheet like I'm inclined to.

My strategy was therefore to try to mimick the Indigenous folks' time-tested <i>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sisters_(agriculture)](Three Sisters)</i> strategy.  This includes planting corn, beans, and squash together.  These crops have a solid nutritional combination, and they cooperate nicely by giving each other soil coverage, a trellis to grow on, and nitrogen fixing.  These crops were also grown here for centuries with minimal industrial overhead, so I know it's got potential.  I threw some sunflowers in the back row too since those are cool and provide a lot of seeds.

I'm not expecting great yields since it's so late in the season and my inexperience will surely lead me to a fatal botch somewhere.  But hopefully a failing dry run will be a good learning experience for later.  

A good first lesson is to better seal the garden from rabbits.  I had a few exciting bean sprouts like this:
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/07-12_chicagoland/10_gardenSprout_r.jpg)

I saw some rabbits escape the garden though, and not many remaining sprouts. I re-attached some screen, but the damage to the beans was already done.

I also should have double-planted more.  A lot of things haven't germinated after a few weeks.

Despite spotty results, it's still nice to step away from the desk and get outside a few minutes to water the sun-dried soil.  It's a good excuse to give this guy some outside time too.
![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/07-12_chicagoland/11_gardenOllie_r.jpg)

Anyway, I've got a bit of everything growing now.  Corn's growing the fastest.
