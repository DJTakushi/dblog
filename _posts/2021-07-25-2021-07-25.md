The tsuyu (rainy season) ended about a week ago, so it's full blown Kansai heat+humidity here.  My runs are all super-weak during the day, and my rooftop exercises have also gotten a lot weaker.  Nights are beautiful though, and I got a more robust bike-light in hopes of trying some nocturnal rides soon.  Nights are also great for drinks on the rooftop or by the river with friends.

Daytime is great beach weather though, and since Thurs/Fri were national holidays, me and my friends Kira (South Africa), Stephanie (Indonesia), Chi (China), Maki (Japan), Luis (Guatemala), and Andre (Germany) went to Shirahama beach down south in Wakayama prefecture.  It was a pretty packed area, but the weather was great and water cool.  We swam, played games, had some drinks and snacks.  The water wasn't as clear as Hawaii, but being on a saltwater beach felt like our trips to see family in Honolulu.

We had stopped at the famous Toretore Ichiba fish market for some seafood to grill that evening.  We got some bentos there, and I had some of the best sashimi that I've ever had.  Can't beat fresh I guess.

We made it back to the house we were staying at, which is owned by Maki's aunt.  We met some of her friends that also happened to be in the area, and played a few games while having drinks and grilling enough food to satisfy all the stomachs.

We then had another day at the beach.  We were playing a "knock the water bottle down with a tennis ball" drinking game, and a few other folks from another gaikokujin group joined us when my distracting-beer-dancing caught their attention.

We got back pretty late, and we were pretty tired from the long days out in the sun, but it was great to cut back and relax a bit with friends.  It's also great having in-depth conversations with folks during a car ride or long night. \

Back in my regular life, I'm getting pretty antsy having to work from my small room all the time.  I've been working on learning more coding skills like the React framework, which is in pretty high demand right now.  I'm also looking to make some videos, but that obviously shouldn't be my highest priority.
That's all I've got for now.  Let me know if you have any questions/comments/concerns. \
