# About page
Howdy.  This is my personal website/blog intended for keeping friends and family up to date with what's going on in my life.  This is my first github-pages / jekyll project, so please bear with me as I figure out technical issues. \
I'm guarding against sharing sensitive info, but I may expand this into some more interesting content in the future. I **do** post some pics/gifs of people and refer to them by a name; if you'd like any personal content removed, please let me know. \
Questions/comments/concerns can be emailed to [okinawanspud@gmail.com](okinawanspud@gmail.com).
