### Favicon Info
Until recently, the character in the favicon used throughout this site is what <strong><i>I</i></strong>'ve used as the first character for my last name in Japanese:

![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/favicons/faviconOld.ico)

I recently found out that it's not actually the correct character.  Read on for details.

My family didn't have any records of the traditional spelling of our family name (that I was aware of).  When I was in Japan, I found that I needed a way to write my name in kanji for traditional institutions that can only operate in Japanese scripts (banks, government, etc.).

I knew that there was a district called <i>Takushi</i> in Okinawa, where my family's name is from:

So I just used that spelling.  It wasn't a bad guess.

According to my preferred online Japanese dictionary, jisho.org, [沢岻](https://jisho.org/search/%E6%B2%A2%E5%B2%BB) is a legitimate spelling of a family name.

Jisho also indicates that the kanji could mean something like "Mt. Swampy."  It's not the most flattering translation, but it's still better than spelling it like a loan-word in katakana (タクシ), which is pretty close to how "<i>taxi</i>" is spelled (タクシー).  

Admittedly though, my selected spelling is derived and not obvious. The second character, 岻, was never recognized by anyone that I met in Japan during my time outside of Okinawa.  This isn't terribly surprising since Okinawa has a lot of kanji unique to the Ryukyu Islands, but the use of 沢 is retrospectively questionable.

The kanji 沢 is more commonly pronounced "<i>sawa</i>" in names like <i>Sawada</i> (沢田).  But notably, it can also be used to spell <i>takusan</i> (たくさん or 沢山), which means something like "in a notably large quantity" (although spelling for this word is more commonly done in hiragana than kanji):

![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/takusan.png){: .img-m}

I kind of like that <i>excessiveness</i>.  I appreciate a job well-done.

However, a few days ago, my Dad found a letter from my Grandfather that had been marked with his [hanko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_(East_Asia)#Japanese_usage), using the spelling 澤岻.  

![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/takushiLetter.jpg){: .img-m}

The first character is different.  Uh-oh.

[Jisho affirms](https://jisho.org/search/%E6%BE%A4%E5%B2%BB) that this is also a legitimate spelling:

![](https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/kanji/takushiSealJisho.PNG){: .img-m}

If 澤岻 is on my Grandfather's seal, it's pretty definitively correct.

Unfortunately, I've already used 沢岻 for important documents and personal branding.  I literally stenciled it on a longboard a few weeks ago.  I'm honestly tempted to keep using 沢岻 for convenience and since it's grown on me.  The simpler character also makes for a clearer and bolder favicon.

But, <i>correct</i> should trump <i>convenient</i>.  It pains me to rewrite my own name, but as they say back in the Old Country, 仕方がない (<i>shikata ga nai</i>), meaning, "<i>it can't be helped</i>".  I'll switch over to the correct spelling for personal branding.

Here's to re-rediscovering the culture of our ancestors.

##### 2022-08-27 Update
I just found out that, per [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%BE%A4), my original 沢 is actually used as a simplified version of 澤.  It's nice knowing both are correct.  I'll still try to use the traditional one since it's more unique and historically correct.
