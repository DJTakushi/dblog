<meta name="description" content="Typhoons have been pretty continuous in Japan for the past few weeks, so Brian and I rescheduled our Fuji-trip to next weekend. Cycling in the rain is sub-optimal, but the cooler weather makes running more satisfying despite the inevitable soggy socks. Because of the bad weather, most of my week off was spent at the house on the computer. That’s admittedly a shameful way to spend precious time off, but in my defense, I couldn’t do much else and I needed to get some things done. While pursuing the new house, 4622 Cherry, I had some business work to complete. [business blabbering redacted] I decided to explore transferring within this company back to the US. Unfortunately, I didn’t see any relevant external listings in Austin nor Denver, but many in Andover Massachusetts, about 45min north of Boston. After about a day of researching the area, I decided that I’d be open to at least try living there for a year or two. While MA seems overregulated, restrictive, and expensive to me, NH is incredibly close (18min) to the Andover office and seems pretty amicable for my goals (practical REI opportunities, good personal economics, and more freedom). If getting transferred fails, my remaining option of returning to the US without a job is still on the table, and such a cowboy adventure of temporary unemployment actually sounds kind of fun. Healthcare.gov indicates that I’d probably qualify for very-cheap-if-not-free healthcare since I have no US income, and I have enough in savings to fly back, get a car/van, and roam about for a while as I find a good place to work. After spending so much time on a computer figuring out my future, I enjoyed going out with some friends last weekend: The potential property, unfortunately, died on the vine. The property wasn’t in great condition and would require some significant repairs in the near future. It’s a seller’s market today, so they weren’t interested in negotiating at all, and the deal quickly became a sub-optimal investment. We terminated and are searching for other candidates. We, unfortunately, allowed our current tenants to get behind on rent, and are looking at either a sizeable loss of revenue from them or taking them to court.
