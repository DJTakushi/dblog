<h3 id="favicon-info">Favicon Info</h3>
<p>Until recently, the character in the favicon used throughout this site is what <strong><i>I</i></strong>‘ve used as the first character for my last name in Japanese:</p>

<p><img src="https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/favicons/faviconOld.ico" alt="" /></p>

<p>I recently found out that it’s not actually the correct character.  Read on for details.</p>

<p>My family didn’t have any records of the traditional spelling of our family name (that I was aware of).  When I was in Japan, I found that I needed a way to write my name in kanji for traditional institutions that can only operate in Japanese scripts (banks, government, etc.).</p>

<p>I knew that there was a district called <i>Takushi</i> in Okinawa, where my family’s name is from:</p>

<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d7157.607515369283!2d127.70834442961082!3d26.235565233695564!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x34e56bed8e4a267d%3A0x8653b043b3a921d1!2sTakushi%2C%20Urasoe%2C%20Okinawa%20901-2112%2C%20Japan!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1661222456586!5m2!1sen!2sus" width="600" height="450" style="margin:auto" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>

<p>So I just used that spelling.  It wasn’t a bad guess.</p>

<p>According to my preferred online Japanese dictionary, jisho.org, <a href="https://jisho.org/search/%E6%B2%A2%E5%B2%BB">沢岻</a> is a legitimate spelling of a family name.</p>

<p><img src="https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/takushiJisho.png" alt="" class="img-m" /></p>

<p>Jisho also indicates that the kanji could mean something like “Mt. Swampy.”  It’s not the most flattering translation, but it’s still better than spelling it like a loan-word in katakana (タクシ), which is pretty close to how “<i>taxi</i>” is spelled (タクシー).</p>

<p>Admittedly though, my selected spelling is derived and not obvious. The second character, 岻, was never recognized by anyone that I met in Japan during my time outside of Okinawa.  This isn’t terribly surprising since Okinawa has a lot of kanji unique to the Ryukyu Islands, but the use of 沢 is retrospectively questionable.</p>

<p>The kanji 沢 is more commonly pronounced “<i>sawa</i>” in names like <i>Sawada</i> (沢田).  But notably, it can also be used to spell <i>takusan</i> (たくさん or 沢山), which means something like “in a notably large quantity” (although spelling for this word is more commonly done in hiragana than kanji):</p>

<p><img src="https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/takusan.png" alt="" class="img-m" /></p>

<p>I kind of like that <i>excessiveness</i>.  I appreciate a job well-done.</p>

<p>However, a few days ago, my Dad found a letter from my Grandfather that had been marked with his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_(East_Asia)#Japanese_usage">hanko</a>, using the spelling 澤岻.</p>

<p><img src="https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/takushiLetter.jpg" alt="" class="img-m" /></p>

<p>The first character is different.  Uh-oh.</p>

<p><a href="https://jisho.org/search/%E6%BE%A4%E5%B2%BB">Jisho affirms</a> that this is also a legitimate spelling:</p>

<p><img src="https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/kanji/takushiSealJisho.PNG" alt="" class="img-m" /></p>

<p>If 澤岻 is on my Grandfather’s seal, it’s pretty definitively correct.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I’ve already used 沢岻 for important documents and personal branding.  I literally stenciled it on a longboard a few weeks ago.  I’m honestly tempted to keep using 沢岻 for convenience and since it’s grown on me.  The simpler character also makes for a clearer and bolder favicon.</p>

<p><img src="https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/favicons/favicon.ico" alt="" />

<p>But, <i>correct</i> should trump <i>convenient</i>.  It pains me to rewrite my own name, but as they say back in the Old Country, 仕方がない (<i>shikata ga nai</i>), meaning, “<i>it can’t be helped</i>”.  I’ll switch over to the correct spelling for personal branding.</p>

<p>Here’s to re-rediscovering the culture of our ancestors.</p>
