<p>Apologies for the overdue update.  I’ve been pretty occupied with finishing my work, closing up in Osaka, saying goodbye to friends, and adjusting to life back in Chicagoland.</p>

<h1 id="2022-01-08">2022-01-08</h1>
<h3 id="starbucks">Starbucks</h3>
<p>I finished my last blog post in a Starbucks in Umeda.  It’s got a vibe.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51930870337_69bcafffe4_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="fukushima-photography">Fukushima Photography</h3>
<p>I shot a bit west of Umeda in the Fukushima ward.  Fukushima-ku’s less hectic than Umeda but still has plenty of excellent restaurants.</p>

<p>I started at an underground garden area by the Umeda Holly’s Cafe that I like to hang out at.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931906188_6a200b5d3a_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I went north up a ramp.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931827501_586b85c092_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Lighting is difficult, so not many shots were very good.  Here’s a neat Offal restaurant:</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931908043_0754dec47f_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Fukushima shop road:</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932445725_8cc29cce45_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Breadshop with manga-style wall-art.  As you can see, the family looks like a happy Mother, Father, adorable daughter, Artist-Uncle, and Bread-Headed-Uncle.  I’d love to hear the story that inspired this.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932160969_12ec99ab17_b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Underground shops by the station.  Most of them were closed, but it seemed scenic.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932450080_7ba8047fff_b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="meow-meow-party">Meow Meow Party</h3>
<p>Afterwards I headed over to Meow-Meow’s for a hot-pot party.  Meow-Meow, his girlfriend Maimai, and our friend Nana enjoy meeting at Maimai’s for hotpot, drinks, and games.  Apartment parties aren’t terribly common in Japan, but Maimai and Meow-Meow are excellent hosts.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932450580_e75243fd3b_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, Nana missed the last train and had to get home to rest up for the next day’s work schedule.  I brought her downstairs to my bike, adjusted the seatpost, clipped my blinking helmet on her head, and sent her on her way.  While that left me with a ~3km walk home, I enjoyed the opportunity for some more photography on the way.</p>

<h3 id="yodogawa-return">Yodogawa Return</h3>
<p>I snapped this waddling cyclist past 2AM.  He was moving so slowly that it was easy to get my camera out, click on a lens, and get a few shots on him.  I don’t know how some people ride so slowly.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931370664_5e408097ac_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I got my fisheye lens for shots like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51930060732_918bfccf2c_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>These apartment buildings (and neon cross) are a landmark along the river.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931123743_2bf5a3fc2c_b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="shinsekai-2022-01-09">Shinsekai (2022-01-09)</h1>
<p>I had to pick up my bike the next day by Nana, who lives by Shinsekai.  Like most lively districts, Shinsekai has an illuminated sign by its dominant areas.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932107349_b8447b23ea_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The food regions are beautiful, but a bit subdued amidst the Omicron-era.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931858193_42bdacc967_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>My parents always say they want more photos of me, so I tried this one by a bridge.  Here ya go, Ma and Pa:</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931778331_dd089359cb_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Fisheye is pretty  nice for broad landscapes as well.  This city is so beautiful at night.  On the right-side you can see the retrovirus-looking <a href="https://www.osakastation.com/shinsekai-and-the-tsutenkaku-tower/">Tsutenkaku</a> tower.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931778551_1358660fac_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here’s a road:</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51930796372_d5a1030ecc_b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="snow-in-osaka-2022-01-12">Snow in Osaka (2022-01-12)</h1>
<p>Osaka had a few snowflakes!  Felt just like home!</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932433555_997ff13a66_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="sunset-by-roof-2022-01-13">Sunset by Roof (2022-01-13)</h1>
<p>Our roof has some good views at sunset.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51930838442_c44282877f_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="meow-meow-party-2022-01-22">Meow Meow Party (2022-01-22)</h1>
<p>Meow-Meow, Maimai, and I had a three-player hot-pot party.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51929797552_815e90d5f1_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="random-cooking-2022-01-25">Random cooking (2022-01-25)</h1>
<p>I thought it’d be neat to video myself working on a stir-fry dinner.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932343779_a86fcb267e_o.gif" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="overcast-day-2022-01-26">Overcast Day (2022-01-26)</h1>
<p>Osaka had an overcast Wednesday that made for some nice shots.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51929800512_15636c566e_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="2022-01-2930">(2022-01-29/30)</h1>

<h3 id="guitar-by-yodogawa">Guitar by Yodogawa</h3>
<p>I like to play acoustic by the river.  It’s chilly these days, but it still vibes.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931994761_c372b2f0f3_o.gif" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="night-out-with-luca">Night out with Luca</h3>
<p>My buddy Luca and I had a night out in Dotonbori.  We started at Balabushkas,</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51929809702_005c03a641_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>…then went to Voyager Stand,</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932336414_a4b1741166_o.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>…and finally returned to Balabushkas.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932336674_66674becfa_o.gif" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="sleeping-gods-2022-01-30">Sleeping Gods (2022-01-30)</h1>
<p>My good buddy Luis invited me to play the game <a href="https://www.redravengames.com/sleeping-gods/">Sleeping Gods</a> at a game lounge.  It’s a choose-your-own-adventure type of game that reminds me of Dungeons and Dragons and features a cool story and beautiful art.  Our team was completed by the lovely Luisa from Berlin, who was a pleasure to talk to.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51930791811_0156bbaa76_b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>A few days later we continued our quest with a new teammate Asa</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932638445_ae8916244e_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We played pretty late into the evening, and I arrived home around 11pm</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931042152_f54843de36_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="night-out-with-luca--vincent-2022-02-04">Night Out with Luca &amp; Vincent (2022-02-04)</h1>
<p>Luca, Vincent, &amp; I visited Balabushkas and Voyager</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931043457_0cc5ce7c2b_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932024476_ec79b8afe3_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="talking-with-kagura--callan-2022-02-08">Talking with Kagura &amp; Callan (2022-02-08)</h1>
<p>During a dinner at the sharehosue I had a long conversation with Callan and Kagura.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934119163_12142b2f2b_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="meow-party-2022-02-10">Meow Party (2022-02-10)</h1>
<p>Meow-Meow, Maimai, and myself had another party.  Maimai showed me her sketch-journal.  Maimai’s a talented photographer and artist, and I enjoyed her portrayal of her life as a black cat coupled with the eccentric cat representing Meow-Meow.  I’m a happy penguin, which makes me pretty happy.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932650665_00de14d0e3_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="hokkaido">Hokkaido</h1>
<p>A few months earlier, Asako invited me to join a trip to Hokkaido with her, Alex, and our friend Devin.  Hokkaido’s been at the top of my list of places to travel, so I of course pounced.</p>

<h3 id="2022-02-11">2022-02-11</h3>
<p>I finished packing for a few days and left my room in its natural cluttered state.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932366154_dc93268b3d_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Snow was clearly visible at the airport.  It felt good to have some brisk weather again.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931056752_8cbdc0cf93_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sapporo, the most prominent city of Hokkaido, is known for heavy snowfall and its lights.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932120208_4ba39a7219_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931057302_ca909aaf20_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932371934_9897c2b6e9_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I checked into my capsule hotel before meeting the crew for dinner.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932038146_9dcd0bb35f_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Alex, Asako, and I met our old friend Sachi at an izakaya.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932080771_6f472bb1e5_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The food was fantastic.  The oysters were excellent both grilled and raw, but the sweet and crunchy fried chicken still makes me hungry just thinking about it.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932369084_90c739be50_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After dinner we cruised around Sapporo.  The State of Emergency ensured that we had a pretty tame night, but we got some drinks from the convenience stores and tried out some outfits at the Don Quijote.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931101392_436c923bb8_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932039196_010874311a_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sachi had to catch her last train and Alex &amp; Asako returned to their hotel, so I took the opportunity to shoot a bit in the city.</p>

<h3 id="niseko-day-1-2022-02-12">Niseko Day 1 (2022-02-12)</h3>
<p>The next day we met early to catch our bus to Niseko-san for snowboarding.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932078161_d7e5e188e2_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>A few hours later, the mountain was in sight</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932412484_7523f72472_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We got our gear, and hit the slopes at Niseko Annpuri.  Hokkaido is known for it’s fluffy snow, and my goodness it didn’t disappoint.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931098282_6c220ef401_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931098327_bf844ec033_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I really enjoyed going through the woods areas since the snow is less ridden and the maneuvering is exciting.  Visibility and focus are pretty nearsighted though, so big drops like this one snuck up on me.  The picture doesn’t capture depth very well, but I believe I avoided a 10+ meter fall onto the main path here.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932382394_c1374a7123_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Eventually night came and we gathered by the bus stop to travel to our lodge.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931072697_dcff4795b6_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Alex and I hustled to the nearest store to get some food and drinks.  It was about 2km with an early closing time, but we made it to the scenic town just in time.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934654384_f9500a9396_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Selection was scarce and prices were high in this mountain village, but we got what we needed to finish the night.</p>

<h3 id="niseko-day-2-2022-02-13">Niseko Day 2 (2022-02-13)</h3>
<p>The next morning we had an excellent breakfast at the lodge.  The staff was very friendly, and  we left for an alternate resort.</p>

<p>After boarding all day, we walked about 40min to the nearest mixed onsen.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931099122_059c282c85_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I’ve got mixed feelings about getting in steaming hot water naked with a bunch of other folks, and I generally find it uncomfortable personally.  This one was outdoors in the snow and very beautiful.  I’d love to share pics, but I was pretty busy being hot, embarrassed about my body, and forbidden from bringing a camera in.</p>

<h3 id="return-2022-02-14">Return (2022-02-14)</h3>
<p>We had to return our gear the next morning, but I got a few neat shots of strangers at the resort.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932064376_8068f03802_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We bussed back to Sapporo and walked around a bit.  Here’s a neat building.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932139223_ebb76eef95_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Hokkaido is known for its fresh and clean seafood, and we got some fresh bowls right next to the fish market.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932140023_91d80a3647_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The fish market was cool.  I got hungry again just off the smells.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932065646_cb52d0d538_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Alex met a worthy opponent in a shoutengai.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932396494_7365299765_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We missed our bus and were freaking out about missing our flight on this road.  We made it by train and by sprint though.</p>

<h1 id="night-out-with-mary-2022-02-18">Night Out with Mary 2022-02-18</h1>
<p>I met my friend Mary from the Philippines.  I brought my camera since we’re both into amateur photography, and I shot a bit by the Umeda Don Quijote rendezvous point as I waited for her to arrive.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931144487_67c9079890_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931144787_0d523ffef4_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We met and talked, and decided to walk south to our favorite bars in Shinsaibashi.  We shot a bit along the way.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932204383_e3e5014053_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932205083_755ac3e06d_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I asked her to pose by some blue lights, but without another illumination sourcee, it looks a bit goofy.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932743145_075e0ae615_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here’s a big ol’ shrine in down Chuo-ku.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932206248_91f314f27d_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We finally made it to a bar she and her friends like to meet at.  We had some good conversations, and I met a lot of cool folks.  It’s wonderful how after nearly three years in Osaka I still find I have so many cool places to visit and excellent people to meet.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932740185_f1ba97e2d5_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Eventually Mary had to return by her last train, so I walked back to my bike and had some pasta before hitting the pillow.</p>

<h3 id="mary-at-the-airport">Mary at the Airport</h3>
<p>Mary and I agreed to meet at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rYPGEk5uwGbZFd1EA">Itami Sky Park</a> by Itami airport to shoot.  It’s very common to see folks shooting pictures of planes by Itami, and today we’d join them.  Unfortunately, Mary was having some difficulty with her new second-hand bike having a flat tire, so she only arrived after the sun set and getting clear shots became difficult.</p>

<p>At last she arrived, but we mostly winged about how cold and windy it was and how much nicer this beautiful park must be during the warmer seasons.</p>

<p>I let her try my road bike, which she loved, but wee had to part ways so I could meet the lads at Torikizoku in Dotonbori.</p>

<h3 id="noahs-last-stand-at-torikizoku">Noah’s Last Stand at Torikizoku</h3>
<p>Noah was soon scheduled for a return to Australia, so Luca 1, Luca 2, Callum, and I assembled for a final night out.  We had some good talks over chicken and beer.  Noah’s a good guy, and he’s got a good future ahead of him.</p>

<h1 id="wakayama-2022-02-2324">Wakayama (2022-02-23/24)</h1>
<p>My friend Ninni was kind enough to show me around Wakayama.  It’s a less-crowded prefecture south of Osaka that features beautiful nature, fresh seafood, and a less stressed pace than Osaka.  I started things out right by meeting her at the incorrect station and shooting photos while I waited for her to pick me up in the car she was renting.</p>

<p>We drove to the fish market and strolled around as we figured out how to treat ourselves.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51933037080_41547e9242_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We settled on grilling fresh fish, vegetables, and oysters.  It was a bit chilly outdoors, but we were warmed by good food and conversation.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932495923_bd22b9065b_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Exiting the market, Ninni showed me that we we actually in a part of a larger amusement park.  It had some very European architecture as well as a rollercoaster, water ride, and a talented juggler.  I wish the buildings were real and enterable, but they were sure nice to look at.  I’d love to visit this place during a warmer season, but Ninni said she believed the park was scheduled to be demolished to make room for a casino.  Pity.</p>

<p>We went to a local lighthouse and saw some wild dogs messing around.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931432907_a78c4d7113_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Climbing to the deck of the lighthouse, I got some neat pics of the small nearby islands.  It’d be excellent to kayak to them and have a party during warmer weather.</p>

<p>We continued to a small fishing neighborhood and had a quick coffee in an adorable cafe built into the rocky hills.</p>

<p>We drove around a bit more as the sun set.  Wakayam’s a beautiful place, and Ninni is a kind sweet person that I enjoyed spending the day with.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931438087_9fe955aaa4_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We returned the car, made some quesadillas, and turned in for the night.</p>

<p>The next morning Ninni brought me to a nice cafe for some coffee and breakfast.  Despite the small serving sizes, it was a good meal with a good vibe.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51932749489_0eeff72016_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately we both had to finish some business that day, so I got on a train back to Osaka.  I got a bit confused with the trains though, and I prematurely exited onto a quite station.  I shot a bit while I waited for the next train.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51931439162_b281767094_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="soubetsukai-2022-02-25">Soubetsukai (2022-02-25)</h1>
<p>I had a 送別会 (soubetsukai), or a farewell party.</p>

<p>Asako recommended getting an AirBnB, but they have a deliberate &lt;16 person policy to prevent raucous parties like the one I definitely needed to throw.  At the suggestion of Luis, I rented a space on <a href="https://www.instabase.jp/">instapace.jp</a>.  It said it seated 12 people, but we blew past that pretty quick.</p>

<p>While our reservation started around 4pm, the first folks to show up were these legends, Norie and Matsuko, at 6pm.  These lovely ladies even brought me a teapot and green tea as a souvenir!</p>

<p>Then Kagura and Luis showed up!  I compelled them to eat the bananas that I had brought:</p>

<p>By the way, my ridiculous outfit is my Glico Man costume, which is based on the famous <a href="https://japantravelmate.com/osaka/dotonbori-strange-sights-glico-man-sign-ebisu-bridge">Dotonbori Glico sign</a>.  It’s a messy shirt that I printed myself, and have worn for the past two Halloweens</p>

<p>Luca and I talked a lot about the Ukraine crisis as it unfolded.  But we also drank a lot, so we felt better.</p>

<p>The absurdly attractive Miku is very photogenic and wanted to get a picture with me.  That makes me like 10x cooler, but I’m still a dork.</p>

<p>It was great to see so many folks that evening.  It was one of my favorite times in Japan, and it’s hard to describe how wonderful it felt to feel so appreciated.  I’ll miss these folks a lot.</p>

<p>Most folks ended up going to The V later in the evening.  I stayed back to clean up, hang with the comrades that wanted to rest the rest of the night, and work on my blog.</p>

<h1 id="noah-farewell-2022-02-26">Noah Farewell (2022-02-26)</h1>
<p>Noah had a chill dinner at a Fukushima-ku Mexican restaurant, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/QcSSsA7Hh5tqDCzt8">QueRico</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51933059247_112b038ec8_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>He and the nomihodai (all-you-can-drink) table got bottomless frozen margaritas.  Callan and I slowly sipped single drinks as we were still pretty burnt out from the previous night.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51936552035_6e36340bbe_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The kind store owner complimented my crude Japanese skills and offered to snap our group’s pic outside.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934360604_24b1105600_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934037026_1d0c9b104a_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Afterwards a few of use returned to the Sharehouse for a final round of drinks with Noah and to play the game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/156546/monikers">Monikers</a>, which Noah received from Luis as a present.  It’s a good game, but contains quite a few references to US culture that made it difficult for our Japanese friends.</p>

<h1 id="albert-tacos-2022-02-27">Albert Tacos (2022-02-27)</h1>
<p>What’s better than Mexican food?  Mexican food two nights in a row.  Albert was kind enough to make some amazing Mexican food at a small apartment party at Alex &amp; Asako’s apartment.  We were joined by Kata, Shinya, Manu, and Kiki.  Albert not only prepared some amazing chipotle and spicy white sauce, but he even showed us how to make fresh tortillas using a nifty press.  Albert’s a really impressive gentleman who cooks a huge variety of foods from scratch.  He’s also moved from a job in translation to a new career in tech, and it’s been inspiring to see him grow into doing whatever interests him.  I wish I had taken some pictures of the food because it was delicious.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51933061722_eeed033217_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This was also the last time I’d see some of these good folks before I left.  It was great to see them, but it was also sad.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51933061622_c0b0fe94d2_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I found that Alex &amp; Asako had a <a href="https://www.moomin.com/en/explore/">Moomin</a> cup, which reminded me of my Finnish friend Ninni.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934060231_a507a8aa36_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="getting-rid-of-stuff">Getting Rid of Stuff</h1>
<p>Moving back to the US involved leaving a lot of things behind.  I investigated shipping my road bike, but it would have cost +$700 for a bike I only paid $400 for.  A cubic meter of shipping would have cost me about $1,200 and would have required that I drive to NYC to pick up the container.  That’s a lot of money for the privilege of driving through the US’s biggest city, so I opted to only take two 23kg suitcases and a 10kg backpack back to the US.
Ridding myself of my other posessions was a bit tricky.  A few things I sold through Facebook or at a recycle shop, and some things I simply wrapped in a plastic bag and fed into the dumpster.  Some too-good-for-the-trash items I was able to gift to friends, including the guitar and cajon that I left with Hotaru.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934384094_7728fa8ba6_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This Danny-sale involved riding around the city a lot of my last few days.  Here’s an intersection.</p>

<h1 id="meow-meow-hotpottacoyaki-2022-03-01">Meow-Meow Hotpot/Tacoyaki (2022-03-01)</h1>
<p>Meow-Meow, Maimai, and I had two back-to-back nights of partying on the Monday of the Final Week.  Nana was supposed to be at the first, but since she had lost her wallet Monday evening, we decided to just repeat on the following Tuesday evening.  We did <a href="https://foodinjapan.org/kansai/oosaka/takoyaki/">tacoyaki</a> the second night since we were so tired of hotpot.  Meow and I had some good convesations on the final evening and hugged each other goodbye.  I know I’ll see him again!</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934683740_7aa9a53df1_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="brian--sakko-in-umeda-2022-03-01">Brian &amp; Sakko in Umeda (2022-03-01)</h1>
<p>I wanted to spend some quality time catching up with Brian and Sakko.  Conveniently, I got to see both on a Tuesday holday!  We got some sashimi, in the Yodobashi Camera building and had some good conversation.  As we exited the building, both Brian and Sakko showed their piano-talent.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51933086707_778a36ede8_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934138968_5ce4d7ce47_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We went over to an open Hub bar to have some bar-snacks and day-drinks.  It was a good time, and it’s hilarious watching Sakko get super-genki after half a drink.</p>

<p>Brian’s planning to be back in Chicagoland around the end of May, so I know I’ll see him again soon.  It’ll be a while until I see Sakko though, and that makes me sad.</p>

<h1 id="last-ride-to-kobe-2022-03-02">Last Ride to Kobe (2022-03-02)</h1>
<p>I found a buyer for my road bike out in Kobe, so I rode the Merida Ride out west one last time.  I had a beautiful last ride along the #2 involving rain, incompetent drivers, and a nice sunset.  As annoying as this road is, I’ll miss it.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934392984_891bd3d013_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>More-so though, I’ll miss my Kobe friends Grace, Zeik, Shaddy, and Mari!  Grace, Zeik, Mari, and I met at Torikizoku one final time, where I gifted my electric guitar and freeline skate to Zeik and he gave me a strawberry cake!  Grace &amp; Zeik are a lovely US husband &amp; wife that are simply excellent folks, and they’ve been kind enough to host at their amazing house out by Suma.  They had to catch an early last-train out West, but Mari and I grabbed some snacks and drinks at the local supermarket to chill in the park one more time.  We said goodbye on the train, but I know I’ll see her again when she visits Illinois!</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934070176_29c0277e2d_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="last-day-2022-03-03">Last Day (2022-03-03)</h1>
<p>As I cleared out my food supplies, I was pleased that Momo, Norie, and Mayuri all appreciated my leftover ingredients.  I had so much chicken left over that they actually threw an impromptu fried-chicken party and made me a salmon-bowl as a gift!  Callan even gave me a super-frothy beer!  I’ve really been blessed to live with these folks, and I’ll certainly miss them a lot.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934685770_463d5bb18f_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="last-night-torikizoku">Last Night Torikizoku</h3>
<p>What’s better than Torikizoku?  Torikizoku two nights in a row.  On my final night, I met Alex, Asako, and Albert at the Umeda Torikizoku.  This is after the previous dinner at the sharehouse, but my limitless stomach didn’t let me down.  We had a good night talking about our futures and home countries.</p>

<p>I also gifted Albert my adjustable kettlebell.  That tool has been by far my favorite exercise tool after my bike and running shoes, and I’m glad that he’ll be able to get some use out of it.  He sure looked funny waddling around Uemda with it though!</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934714780_042820a20b_o.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>I said goodbye to these folks.  I miss them a lot already.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934410714_e1cf0a778a_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I went home and finished packing around 3am in the morning.  I wish I had been squared away earlier, but I’m glad I got to see as many people as I did.</p>

<h1 id="flights-home-2022-03-04">Flights Home (2022-03-04)</h1>
<p>Traveling home itself was stressful.  My big worries were failures due to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>My luggage was a few kilograms above the weight limit</li>
  <li>Canada could deny me transit due to their vaccine requirement for arrival</li>
  <li>The US could me entry due to my covid test being entirely in Japanese</li>
  <li>Connecting my flights into Haneda and out of Narita required a bus whose timetable didn’t leave me much margin for error</li>
</ul>

<p>So in the morning, I raced around town copying documents, mailing items for work and pension-reimbursemnt, and getting a final covid test.  Himu-san was kind enough to help me call a cab, and I rushed to Itami Airport.  The kind lady at check-in helped me through some booking difficulties, and while she definitely detected that  my bags were heavy, she only put a “Heavy” tag on them and neglected any fees before lifting them onto the conveyor belt.  God bless her.</p>

<p>A smaller plane took us to Tokyo.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51933112822_61bd170695_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I was pretty pumped to have made it this far in my quest.  I went to the bathroom to celebrate.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51933112522_524135f180_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I awaited the shuttle bus from Haneda to Narita patiently…</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934707760_fc36080f52_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And biff, boof, Bob’s your uncle!  The bus arrived on time, I raced through check-in, and made it to the terminal!  I got my residence card punched, signed some papers from the government telling me that I voided all my re-entry rights, and I took the remaining hour or so to reflect and write a bit.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934710855_b9798157db_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The plane boarded, and we were off to Canada.  I sighed in relief as this likely meant that I was good to enter both Canada and the US.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934458679_1cf705058d_o.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>I wasn’t able to sleep much, so I watched <em>Dune</em>.  It was visually beautiful, but the premises caused me to raise an eyebrow a few times.  (These folks have dragonfly-winged aircraft, but you mean to tell me that they fight each other with swords instead of God’s META weapon, the AR-15?  OUTRAGEOUS AND UNREALISTIC TRASH.  I GIVE IT 7/9 STARS.)</p>

<p>I landed in Vancouver.  It felt strangely emotional to return to Western soil.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934154601_4e71d301ab_o.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>I broke in the new continent with a Tim Horton’s chicken sandwich.  It was excellent, and I continued writing as I waited.  It felt a little strange being surrounded by so many non-Japanese people.  I found my eyes wandering onto people much more than in Osaka Station.  It’s rude to stare, but a lot of times I couldn’t help myself.</p>

<p>There was a really cute girl that I overheard speaking German on the phone, but I couldn’t think of a good way to start a conversation with her, so I just kept writing.  I’ve gotten to be a lot more outgoing these past few years, so it feels upsetting to find myself acting so reserved again.  I ought to re-break those habits, but, you know, also not be a creep at the same time.</p>

<p>Anyway, after Cute-Airport-Girl abandoned me for her flight, I got on the plane to Chicago and arrived after 8pm.  My parents came to pick me up, but it was difficult to find them since my phone’s mobile data no longer worked in the New Country.  I puttered around trying to find them in the airport.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51937157315_1f9efb755d_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Once wee connected, we drove home, stopping at Culver’s for chicken sandwiches.  I reconnected with our dog Oliver, who thankfully still remembers me after nearly three years.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51936608313_23a682313b_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I sighed a lot that evening.  It was good to be home, but it’s still incredibly strange.</p>

<h1 id="skokie-illinois-2022-03-04-present">Skokie, Illinois (2022-03-04-present)</h1>
<p>For the sake of healthy and sustainable habits, I took the jet-lagged opportunity to start waking up early and knock out my exercise in the morning.  I checked out the weather, and saw a few cyclists zip down Church street.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934779415_efb0a3a635_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>That was reassuring.  I miss cycling with folks in Kansai, so it’s good to see some potential new comrades out and getting after it.</p>

<p>The weather was good enough (~10degC) to do a simple calisthenics session in the backyard.  Kansai is an exceptionally beautiful place, but as the sun rose I was reminded that Chicagoland can be nice at times as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934164051_9e4c07c61f_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I’m doing most of the cooking at home to support my parents.  I stocked up on some materials at local grocery, and noted the olive oil section.  For Japanese standards, the American selection and sizes are notably obscene.  The absurd amount of olive oil made me think of Manu back in Osaka, whose family owns an olive orchard back in Spain.  I miss that gentleman, and I’m upset knowing that I likely won’t see him for a while.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934258088_19d75d9596_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I’m also upset that calrose rice costs so much here!  Back in Osaka this would be like half the price!  I made the frugal decision and got normal American rice, but it always turns out unfulfilling and disappoinging when I cook it.</p>

<p>Ugh, does life has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ctrl+z</code>?  I want to go back.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934488854_45b78b3927_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I went for a sunrise run the next morning by Northwestern.  You can see downtown Chicago about 20km south.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51933185202_34e0fb044d_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I made some tea from the teabags that Sakko gave me as a present.  I miss her a lot too.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934491779_89f1b97176_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>THANKFULLY, I saw some of the good-folks in Chicago!  I rode my bike down into the West Loop to meet my friend Chantal at <a href="https://g.page/artopolischi?share">Artopolis</a> for some coffee.  She’s from Taiwan, and was a big inspiration/supporter for me going to Japan.  It was good to talk and exchange stories from these past years.</p>

<p>My buddy Steven hosted Dan, Jessie, Sophie, and myself at his and his lovely girlfriend Megan’s place!  It was good to unwind with them and hug some old friends that go back as far as elementary school.  I wish I had gotten some more pics, but here’s Soph with the Young Riley.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51934165831_c56de3b8e8_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It was a Sunday, so folks had to turn in.  I rode back, but it was snowing pretty wet chunks, and I got pretty cold on the journey back.  Should have worn waterproof gear.</p>

<p>The snow was still there Monday morning.  Dad was kind enough to take this one for me.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51933186302_c001a44132_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Truthfully, I kind of like the cold weather as long as I’m not wet.  It’s actually nice for running since I don’t overheat in freezing temperatures.</p>

<p>I kept on running the next few days.  Here’s the river between Skokie &amp; Evanston.</p>

<p>A simple lunch that I made for my folks this morning.</p>

<p><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51936978429_f3ff9845d8_c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This update is obviously late, long, and undetailed around current events.  There’s much more information to share with you, but I’m trying to push this content out when it’s acceptable instead of when it’s perfect.  Despite being unemployed, I’ve been pretty busy lately.</p>

<p>As you may know, my Mom isn’t in good health.  I’m trying to be supportive by helping with food and cleaning, but I’ve also been busy discussing related topics with her and Dad as we figure out future plans.  Additionally, I’m traveling to Atlanta tomorrow to help my sister with our rental properties, which have been increasingly looming over me lately.</p>

<p>It’s a strange time in my life right now, and I’m sorry I didn’t get this out earlier.  While I primarily started this blog to share with my parents, I’m now working on this for the folks that I had to leave back in Osaka.  I’ll try to keep this updated with better content (formatting, lol) and more frequently.  Professional-grade content delivered every two weeks is the goal, but please bear with me as I hack through these goofy next few weeks.</p>

<p>As always, feel free to reach out to me.  <a href="dannytakushi@gmail.com">dannytakushi@gmail.com</a> or your preferred channel ought to do.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Danny</p>
