I arrived in Atlanta mid-March to sink my teeth into the real estate business.</p>

<h2 id="atl-1-03-13---03-23">ATL 1 (03-13 -&gt; 03-23)</h2>
<p>I was very anxious to get to the rental houses that my partner and I own.  On one hand it was a joy to see these properties in person.</p>

<p><img src="https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/2022-03-13_atl1/1_houseOverwhelm_r.jpg" alt="" class="img-m" />
On the other hand, I quickly felt overwhelmed.  Items that used to be simple numbers on a spreadsheet quickly unfolded into complex webs of problems.  Problems have solutions, but finding the best solution requires wading through a sea of information and thought.  Searching for a good solution, I often found more problems and more questions than when I began.  A small todo-list that I had budgeted to knock out in a few weeks quickly grew into a long novel to tasks.</p>

<p>Take this door for instance.</p>

<p><img src="https://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-999872866258.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/blog/2022/2022-03-13_atl1/2_houseDoor_r.jpg" alt="" class="img-m" /></p>

<p>This door was supposed to be a quick fix: remove the temporary, OSB swap in a new pre-hung unit from Home Depot, and move on.  Any 2-bit Neanderthal should be able to handle this in half of a day.  Instead, investigation showed that there was moisture accumulating at the bottom that had caused the subfloor to swell.  Removing the subfloor involved removing some of the new vinly plank, which required removing some of the baseboard moulding, during which I dented some drywall and damaged the moulding.  Exposing the subfloor showed that the framing had been damaged and should be replaced.  But the framing is load-bearing, and requires installing jacks to lift up to clear out the rotted plate.  But since the old deck is anchored, the deck will need to be removed, moved a few feet West, and supported on jacks before it is returned.  And by the way, there’s a particleboard subfloor that will irreparably swell if it gets wet, and best practice is to completely remove it before we build partition walls on top of it.  And beneath that is plywood subfloor, which is only 7/16”, and probably thinner than recommended for anyone more massive than a typical Takushi.  Oh, and the siding is a mix of particleboard that is also not best practice.  And the gutters that splashed water down here ought to be replaced.  Also, the deck itself hasn’t been built to contemporary standards and should have probably half the pieces replaced.  Neglecting any of these problems could be a liability, so these problems need solutions.</p>

<p>If you followed me through that, you can hopefully understand that this 2-bit Neanderthal couldnt’ finish this in half of a day.  I must have spent multiple days reading and researching what the best solution is, how to help pay for it, and whether or not I could handle the task myself.  We’d get a handyman out to take a look at it, have them stop working when they figured out the problem was bigger than they could handle, and get another guy who quoted us an estimate thousands of dollars higher than we were ready to pay.</p>

<p>I had hoped to be done in Atlanta before my Dad’s retirement party in a few weeks, but that didn’t happen.</p>

<p>On the plus side, I figured out how to get work done.  Neither of the properties I found to be great work environments, especially given the lack of internet in the vacant house.  I’d often go to Panera to get some carbs, coffee, and spend some time researching home improvement, DIY solutions, and local labor.</p>

<p>The houses themselves were nice places to live though for the most part.  There are more pics later.</p>

<h2 id="dads-retirement-03-23---03-27">Dad’s retirement (03-23 -&gt; 03-27)</h2>
<p>So a few weeks later, my sister I drove up to Dad’s retirement party in Chicago.</p>

<p>There was a lot of really heart-warming testimony about our Father and his long career in the office.  Dad rarely discusses his job with us, so it was really refreshing to hear about his good performance and supportive role in his team’s culture.  I should have taken more pictures.</p>

<p>While I was up in Chicago, I of course went running.  A cat with glasses drawn on a sign of course reminded me of my friend Meow-Meow back in Kansai.

<p>We had obligations back in Atlanta on Monday, so we drove back South the following day.  Taco Bell along the way was good.

<h2 id="atl-2-03-27---04-09">ATL 2 (03-27 -&gt; 04-09)</h2>
<p>I gained more traction back in Atlanta.  Walls were painted, plumbing was fixed, and deck boards replaced.  I spent a few hours in the sun patching this roof after I found leaks by the satellite dish.<br />

<p>It’s fine now.

<p>And again, it was nice catching up with my sister over dinner from time to time.
