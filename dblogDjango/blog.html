Sorry I’m a week late with this.  I’m trying to add some Japanese versions for my friends over here (and personal practice) but I’m pushing this with incomplete translations to get the already-late material out.</p>

Merry Christmas &amp; Happy Holidays!  I’ve never written a Christmas Card before, but considering that I haven’t seen most of you folks since I moved to Osaka, I figure this is a decent opportunity for a long-overdue check-in.</p>

      <p>Sorry this is a week late.  Last weekend was packed, and this week has been busy with work.  I typically cook, but I didn’t have time a few days this week and went to Pizza-Hut instead.

      <h2 id="09-25-rooftop-bbq">09-25 Rooftop BBQ</h2>
<p>We had a BBQ on the rooftop last weekend.  The sunlight was pretty severe, so we made some shade under a strung-up tarp by the laundry-lines.  Some old friends came by to visit, and it was a nice time to catch up with a flaming grill, some cold drinks, and a flapping roof.

      <p>Sorry this is late, I’ve been distracted lately. <br />
I’m trying hosting images using imgur since it scales better than gitHub, but I’m not really liking their embed system.  I’ll probably try to find an alternative soon.</p>

      <h2 id="fuji">Fuji</h2>
<p>I went with my buddy Brian to Fuji-san last weekend.  It was a haphazardly planned trip, and we made the snap-decision to camp 5km away from Gotemba station on Friday night.  I loaded up my camping gear, and hopped on the Shinkansen for Mishima Station.  You can barely see the mountain from the train:</p>

      <p>Typhoons have been pretty continuous in Japan for the past few weeks, so Brian and I rescheduled our Fuji-trip to next weekend.  Cycling in the rain is sub-optimal, but the cooler weather makes running more satisfying despite the inevitable soggy socks. <br />
Because of the bad weather, most of my week off was spent at the house on the computer.  That’s admittedly a shameful way to spend precious time off, but in my defense, I couldn’t do much else and I needed to get some things done.  While pursuing the new house, 4622 Cherry, I had some business work to complete.<br />
[business blabbering redacted]
I decided to explore transferring within this company back to the US.  Unfortunately, I didn’t see any relevant external listings in Austin nor Denver, but many in Andover Massachusetts, about 45min north of Boston.  After about a day of researching the area, I decided that I’d be open to at least try living there for a year or two.  While MA seems overregulated, restrictive, and expensive to me, NH is incredibly close (18min) to the Andover office and seems pretty amicable for my goals (practical REI opportunities, good personal economics, and more freedom).  If getting transferred fails, my remaining option of returning to the US without a job is still on the table, and such a cowboy adventure of temporary unemployment actually sounds kind of fun.  Healthcare.gov indicates that I’d probably qualify for very-cheap-if-not-free healthcare since I have no US income, and I have enough in savings to fly back, get a car/van, and roam about for a while as I find a good place to work. <br />
After spending so much time on a computer figuring out my future, I enjoyed going out with some friends last weekend:</p>

      <p>Sorry I don’t have much cool multimedia this time.  Life hasn’t been very photo-worthy lately.
It’s <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2286.html">Obon</a> in Japan, so I’ve got the week off.  I’m planning on climbing Fuji-san next Saturday with my friend Brian, but my current main focus is the new property Sarah &amp; I just made an offer on. <br />
[business blabbering redacted] <br />
I’ve also been working on getting more video footage and editing.  I’m trying to get my stupid demo out, but my computer’s been having trouble handling the editing software.  I’m considering getting a more powerful machine, but it seems kind of wasteful considering my desktop back home could probably handle it fine and I’ll have it back soon. <br />
Here’s some stupid B-roll of Umeda station that I botched while filming but was small enough to convert to a .gif.</p>

      <p>The tsuyu (rainy season) ended about a week ago, so it’s full blown Kansai heat+humidity here.  My runs are all super-weak during the day, and my rooftop exercises have also gotten a lot weaker.  Nights are beautiful though, and I got a more robust bike-light in hopes of trying some nocturnal rides soon.  Nights are also great for drinks on the rooftop or by the river with friends.</p>
